# Fun with "Dynamic" Typing: An Introduction to Universes

This is a simple introduction to universes, a tool that can be used in dependently-
typed languages to get all the convenience of dynamic types (often referred to in
academia as "generic programming") from inside a strong static type system. My code
is written in Idris, but this guide is aimed at people who know Haskell or OCaml
but are new to dependent typing. (At least, I hope. If someone in the target audience
finds something unclear, feel free to submit an issue!)
